\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}

Here I will suggest some future directions. The sequence of models we built up 
in this thesis are a progression toward models of neural ``programs.'' Already, 
our switching linear dynamical systems allow us to express complex, nonlinear 
dynamics. By conditioning upon outside stimuli, these models looks more and more 
like closed loop programs. In future work, I would like to make this connection 
concrete by showing how simple classes of probabilistic programs can be 
instantiated as a prior distribution on patterns of neural activity, and how 
they may be inferred from actual neural data. Example classes of programs 
may be those that implement simple forms of Bayesian inference, or those 
that attempt to maximize a reward function. Certainly our first examples will 
be simple, but this is clearly the direction in which our methods are pointing.
