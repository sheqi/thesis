\chapter{Background}
In order to make sense of the rest of the thesis, some background is required. 
I think a section on probabilistic modeling will be helpful, but I would 
like to keep it short since there are already many good references on the 
subject. I will then introduce point processes, specifically the Poisson 
process, the Hawkes process, and the nonlinear Hawkes process, for which 
I have developed inference methods. Then I will introduce time series 
models, including the hidden Markov model (HMM), linear dynamical system (LDS),
and the vector autoregressive (VAR) models. In subsequent chapters, I 
will show how these can be combined with Poisson process observations.
Finally, I may discuss network models, since I have two chapters that draw 
on this material. Alternatively, I may defer the network models until 
the next chapter, where they are first used.
