In joint work with Zhe Chen, Matt Johnson, and Matthew Wilson, I have been 
developing nonparametric hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden Markov models 
(HDP-HMMs) for neural spike train recordings and applying them to hippocampal 
data recorded in the Wilson lab. The advantage of these nonparametric methods 
is that the number of states is inferred in a data-driven way, allowing the 
complexity of the model to grow with that of the data. However, inference 
becomes more challenging. In this work, we have conducted a thorough empirical 
study that compares parametric and nonparametric methods, as well as a 
variety of inference algorithms and approaches to setting the hyperparameters 
(which can have a large effect on the subsequent inferences). A preliminary 
version of this work is on the arXiv \cite{linderman2014nonparametric}, and 
we are submitting final revisions to the Journal of Neuroscience Methods 
this week.
