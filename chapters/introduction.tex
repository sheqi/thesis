\chapter{Introduction}
\label{introduction}

I will provide the context for this thesis in a brief introduction.
I will touch on the goals of computational neuroscience and the current 
state of affairs in the field. I will make my pitch for the suite of 
machine learning methods I have developed for extracting patterns in neural recordings,
and I will frame this as a step toward closing the gap between bottom-up
neural data analysis and top-down theories of neural computation.

% The confluence of advanced recording techniques for measuring neural 
% activity and scalable machine learning algorithms makes this a 
% particularly exciting time in computational neuroscience. In some organisms,
% we already have access to whole-brain recordings. In order to understand the 
% computations neural circuits implement, we need to approach this problem 
% from the both the top down and the bottom up. That is, we need 
% theories of neural computation that rest on principled foundations, and 
% we need statistical methods capable of instantiating these theories 
% in probabilistic models and testing them against large-scale brain recordings.
% This thesis is about building a suite of statistical models and computational 
% algorithms that expands the frontier of models that we can efficiently 
% instantiate and fit. In doing so, we continue to close the gap between our theory 
% of neural computation and our methods of analysis.
